# Secure CI/CD Pipeline with Kubernetes (DevSecOps)

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins, Kubernetes, and modern monitoring tools.  
It automates source code validation, security scanning, artifact storage, deployment, and observability, following real-world industry best practices.

---

## Architecture Overview
The system follows a **layered logical architecture** that separates CI/CD automation, application runtime, and monitoring.

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages
The CI/CD pipeline is organized into clear, modular stages:

- [01 – Build Step (CI/CD & Code Quality)](01-build-step/README.md)
- [02 – Security Step](02-security-step/README.md)
- [03 – Deploy Step (Kubernetes)](03-deploy-step/README.md)
- [04 – Monitoring Step](04-monitoring-step/README.md)

---

## End-to-End Workflow Summary
1. A developer pushes code to the source repository.
2. Jenkins triggers the CI/CD pipeline automatically.
3. Static code quality analysis and security scans are performed.
4. Build artifacts and container images are stored in Nexus.
5. Applications are deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.
6. Prometheus collects system and cluster metrics.
7. Grafana visualizes dashboards and alerts.
